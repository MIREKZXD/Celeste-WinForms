# Celeste: Fan-made WinForms Remake

This is my first experience with game development. I did this for my high school project. I didn't know anything about it at the beginning, so some parts of the code are unnecessarily complicated, but you learn by doing :D.

I'm giving the code freely for download, so you can also maybe get inspired or solve some problem with the game in Forms.

I'm glad to have this project behind me and I'm going to look further into Unity and game development, it's something that really got me interested.

So don't stop and happy coding!

Special thanks to my friend who I worked with in parallel so we were able to be faster in development and also to the team around the original Celeste game, which I was very excited about and decided to remake. Thank you.
